Google Map Plugin
-----------------

This plugin provides google maps as both a standalone elgg view and a widget.
It can automatically populate itself from special markup included on the
page.  

<div class='gmapped' address='Boston, MA'>Boston Brewery</div>
<div class='gmapped' latlng='(42,-79)'>Gearheads Go Here</div>

This element can be generated by calling the gmap_marker() function defined in
start.php.  One possible use would be to use extend_view() on the default view
for a user, extracting the user's location to put in the map marker.

The contents of the div, if any, will be used to populate a popup info window
(option 'html' if calling the PHP function).

Additional attributes (pass as options if calling the PHP function):

* origin: if provided, causes clicks on the element with the given ID to center
the map to the marker and open the info window.
* type: if provided, selects a marker icon (see images/markers/*.png for
available types).

The view may be passed markers directly in it's $vars array.

The plugin normally scans the page for gmap markup and will auto-populate
itself with new markers whenever a widget finishes its ajax load.  Pass
'autoPopulate'=>false to the view to disable this behavior.
